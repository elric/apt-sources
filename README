				   #### aptsources ####

aptsources is a script for those who don't want or need a GUI to quickly modify
source entries in files under 'sources.list.d/'.

It can enable, disable, add repos and more functions. It also provides a bash_completion
file.

The script is self-instalable, but the file 'bash_completion' must be manually
copied to '/etc/bash_completion.d/aptsources'.
