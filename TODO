TODO: Only one argument a time is allowed
check if already enabled or disabled
give option to apt-get update after command
check proper bash script logging | output
-lp: apt-get update is used to get the key, and another upd is 
necessary. so use wget from the other script 

check_lines doesn't work with -d because grep doesn't tell if one or both
lines are commented. Therefore, -d fails because a repo counts as
$sources_enabled when only the deb line is uncommented.  I need 3 states,
enabledbin, enabledsrc and disabled, or sthg like that.
